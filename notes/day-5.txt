Routing:
-------------------
client-side => routes help you to navigate to different components and load them dynamically in page through root component at the client side browser

Routing engine => Router (a built-in service class)
Route => just a type to create a route [component, path,...]
Routes => a type representing an array of Route objects

ActivatedRoute => an object to store a navigation details of current route (built-in service class)
RouterState => holds a series of objects (ActivatedRoute) to maintain a details of every navigation (built-in service class)

RouterOutlet => an outlet (context) where any routed component will be dynamically loaded (built-in component)
RouterLink => acts like a hyperlink and helps you navigate to a route (built-in directive)

1. create several routes
2. add them in the Routes
3. register with appconfig.ts file
4. need to use an "outlet" in root component where these "routed" components can be dynamically loaded based on route change
