Routing:
-------------------
client-side => routes help you to navigate to different components and load them dynamically in page through root component at the client side browser

Routing engine => Router (a built-in service class)
Route => just a type to create a route [component, path,...]
Routes => a type representing an array of Route objects

ActivatedRoute => an object to store a navigation details of current route (built-in service class)
RouterState => holds a series of objects (ActivatedRoute) to maintain a details of every navigation (built-in service class)

RouterOutlet => an outlet (context) where any routed component will be dynamically loaded (built-in component)
RouterLink => acts like a hyperlink and helps you navigate to a route (built-in directive)

pathMatch:
---------------
the path-matching strategy, one of 'prefix' or 'full'. Default is 'prefix'.

By default, the router checks URL elements from the left to see if the URL matches a given path and stops when there is a config match. Importantly there must still be a config match for each segment of the URL. For example, '/team/11/user' matches the prefix 'team/:id' if one of the route's children matches the segment 'user'. That is, the URL '/team/11/user' matches the config {path: 'team/:id', children: [{path: ':user', component: User}]} but does not match when there are no children as in {path: 'team/:id', component: Team}.

The path-match strategy 'full' matches against the entire URL. It is important to do this when redirecting empty-path routes. Otherwise, because an empty path is a prefix of any URL, the router would apply the redirect even when navigating to the redirect destination, creating an endless loop.

1. create several routes
2. add them in the Routes
3. register with appconfig.ts file
4. need to use an "outlet" in root component where these "routed" components can be dynamically loaded based on route change
