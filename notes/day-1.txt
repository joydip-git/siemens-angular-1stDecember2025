Angular
------------------------

A. Installation and environment set up:
---------------------------------------------
s/w: Node JS
1. nodejs.org
	Current: 25
	LTS: 24 (download)
*alongside node package manager (NPM) is installed

Node JS installation path: C:\Program Files\nodejs

3rd party packages installed globally using NPM are placed into:
C:\Users\<user-name>\AppData\Roaming\npm

Node JS: JavaScript runtime

2. Visual Studio Code (VS code)

3. Command Line Interface (CLI) tool to create, build, run an Angular app: 
	Angular CLI

package: @angular/cli
global installation command for Angular CLI using NPM is:

a. installation command: >npm install @angular/cli --location=global
b. uninstallation command: >npm uninstall @angular/cli --location=global
c. check Angular CLI version: ng version

installation path: C:\Users\<user-name>\AppData\Roaming\npm

Angular Learning Curve:
----------------------------------
JavaScript
TypeScript (superset of JS)
Node JS
JS based application ecosystem (compilers, bundlers etc.)
component based web application

Front-end frameworks/libraries:
------------------------------------
React JS, Angular, Vue JS etc.

Backend frameworks/libraries:
------------------------------------
Express JS, Nest JS, Next JS (to build React app) etc.

Introduction Angular:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
JS/TS based front-end framework to create component based web application
Nice feature (data binding) to pass data from component code to the template to be displayed
Nice feature (event binding) to invoke/bind an function written in code file with an event of a template control
declarative programming style
create application using MV-* architecture to separate logic/code
ex: MV-C, MV-VM, MV-P 
DI framework
provides facilities to make HTTP requests
provides routing system
etc.


component based web app architecture:
-------------------------------------------

contents
--------------------------------------------
header.html + header.js/ts
<div>
	<p>
</div>

footer.html + footer.js/ts
<div>
	<p>
</div>

card.html (view/design/template) + 	card.js/ts (code)
----------------------------------------------------------
<div (click)="onDivClick('hi')" >	name="joydip"
	<p>{{name}}</p>			onDivClick(a:string){}
</div>

side-panel.html + side-panel.ts/js
<div>
	<p>
</div>

master page
index.html
<html>
	<head>...
	<body>
		
	</body>
</html>

.jsx/.tsx => html + code
.ts (code) + .html (template)

web application hosting during development:
--------------------------------------------------------
application development server (app server): host the current web app using some port number (apart from 8080) and serve the static resources
	- live server [add as plugin/extension in VS Code]
	- lite server
	- webpack dev server
	- ts server etc.

Hot Module Replacement (HMR) - keeping the browser in sync with the latest changes made in the hosted web app

styling:
-------------------
css-property-name: value

background-color:'burlywood'

1. in-line with the element using 'style' attribute of the element
2. out-line styling:
	a. in the same HTML document using "style" tag
		i. element selector
		ii. id selector
		iii. class selector

HTML + CSS + JavaScript, DOM, JS engine
JS Engine/Interpreter/compiler

web app: 
	-> runtime provided by the browser process 
	-> JS engine (part of the browser compiles and executes the JS code)

Different JS engines:
Chrome: V8 
firefox: Spidermonkey
safari: JS Core (current version name: Indigo)


out of the browser JS runtime:
---------------------------------
Node JS, Deno JS etc.

JavaScript:
--------------------
loosely typed language
JS does not offer any string typification
data types: Boolean, string, number, object
no strict type checking
object based programming language, NOT object oriented
OOP like features are made available through a different way, known as 'prototype based programming'
objects in JS is just collection of keys/properties and their values

TypeScript:
--------------------
NOT a loosely typed language, rather a strongly typed language and if not strongly typed, type inference is used to interpret the data type of any variable
TS does offer any string typification
data types: Boolean, string, number, object
extra types: any, unknown, partial, readonly etc.
strict type checking
object based programming language, NOT object oriented
OOP like features are made available through a different way, known as 'prototype based programming'
objects in JS is just collection of keys/properties and their values

2009
Ryan Dahl created Node JS framework based on the JS engine V8

2015 ECMA


transapiler -> transformer + compiler

TS to JS transpilation is done by TypeScript Compiler (tsc)

command to install (local): npm i typescript -D
	all the typescript related packages will be installed inside node_modules folders present inside the root of the app directory

command to install (global): npm i typescript --location=global
	all the typescript related packages will be installed inside node_modules folders present inside C:\Users\<uname>\AppData\Roaming\npm folder


package.json file => maintains list of packages on which the current application depends
>npm init --yes/-y

package installation:
	global installation (>npm install --location=global <package-name>)
	local installation (>npm install <package-name>)
		a. complete dependency (>npm install <package-name>)
		b. development dependency (>npm install <package-name> -D)

JS internals:
-------------------
when any JS function is invoked (including the global function), JS runtime creates an instance for that function, known as function execution context (FEC), which contains 3 properties
	'this' property: a property to hold reference of an object (which stores 'this' data of the function)
	varobj property: a property to hold reference to an object (which stores local variables of the function)
	scope property: a property to hold reference to an object (which stores all the variables of the function's outer scope)
